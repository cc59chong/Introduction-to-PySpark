# Introduction-to-PySpark
## Description

Spark is a tool for doing parallel computation with large datasets and it integrates well with Python. You'll use PySpark package to work with data about flights from Portland and Seattle. You'll learn to wrangle this data and build a whole machine learning pipeline to predict whether or not flights will be delayed. 
### Getting to know PySpark
How Spark manages data and how can you read and write tables from Python.
### Manipulating data
About the pyspark.sql module, which provides optimized data queries to your Spark session.
### Getting started with machine learning pipelines
PySpark has built-in, cutting-edge machine learning routines, along with utilities to create full machine learning pipelines.
### Model tuning and selection
Create a model that predicts which flights will be delayed.
