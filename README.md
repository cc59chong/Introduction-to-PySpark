## Description

Spark is a tool for doing parallel computation with large datasets and it integrates well with Python. You'll use PySpark package to work with data about flights from Portland and Seattle. You'll learn to wrangle this data and build a whole machine learning pipeline to predict whether or not flights will be delayed.
